Running on the Unreal Engine 3, it is the tenth main installment in the Mortal Kombat video game series and a sequel to the 2011 game Mortal Kombat. It was released on April 14, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. NetherRealm studio's mobile team developed a version for iOS and Android devices. A version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was in development but was eventually cancelled because NetherRealm could not get the seventh generation of consoles versions to the expected level of quality. High Voltage Studios developed the PC version of the game, with Polish studio QLoc taking over the work on it shortly after the release of Kombat Pack 1.",
